The collection of community contributed TensorFlow models, known as the TensorFlow Model Zoo, is maintained as a collection of user contributed links on the [wiki](https://github.com/trinity77/android/wiki/TensorFlow-Model-Zoo) of this repo.  The most efficient method for researchers and engineers to share their models is to house the information in their own GitHub repo and add an entry to the [TensorFlow Model Zoo](https://github.com/trinity77/android/wiki/TensorFlow-Model-Zoo) wiki.

The models stored in this repo are maintained by their respective authors.  Pull Requests to add new models directly to the repo are not actively monitored.  Please use a different GitHub repo and add an entry to your model to the [TensorFlow Model Zoo](https://github.com/trinity77/android/wiki/TensorFlow-Model-Zoo) wiki.
