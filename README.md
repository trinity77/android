TensorFlow based models shared by the community are collected on the [TensorFlow Model Zoo](https://github.com/trinity77/android/wiki/TensorFlow-Model-Zoo).  The most efficient method for researchers and engineers to share their models is to house the information in their own GitHub repo and add an entry to the [TensorFlow Model Zoo](https://github.com/trinity77/android/wiki/TensorFlow-Model-Zoo).

Pull Requests to add new models directly to the repo are not actively monitored.  The model code stored in this repo is mantained by their respective authors.  

## Models
